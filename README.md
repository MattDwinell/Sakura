# Sakura
~From gardeners to gardens~
Sakura aims to bridge the gap between those who have gardens but not the time to garden, and those who have the inclination to garden but not the space. It fosters the connection between an aspirational class of gardeners in apartments and those who would like gardens but don't have the energy/time to put into them. Sakura works in a similiar manner to a dating app, with preferences tailored to gardening rather than dating.

This app was created as part of a collaborative effort from Suraj Patel, Katie Humburg, and Matthew Dwinell. Questions and comments should be directed to them.
